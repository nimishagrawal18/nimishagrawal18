- 👋 Hi, I’m @nimishagrawal18
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Gaming and basically technology as a whole 😊 (I can talk to you regarding pretty much anything related to tech 😁)
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning Data Structures and Algorithms since I've revisited Coding after a brief break. Next stop : contributing to FOSS!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. If you need help on any project, I'm pretty sure I can help in some way. Especially interested in working on IoT related projects!
